<strong>Project Description:</strong> <br>
In this project, I had to make a simpler version of an old-fashioned text-based adventure game, using Python. <br><br>
<strong> Project goals: </strong> <br>
 -Output text to the console. <br>
 -Import modules and use functions from those modules. <br>
 -Use the input function in combination with conditional statements (e.g., if and while) to create an interactive program. <br>
 -Use a conditional loop to handle invalid input. <br>
 -Use a conditional loop to handle invalid input. <br>
 -Use a conditional loop to handle invalid input. <br>
 -Refactor code by defining and calling functions. <br>
 -Write code that follows the standard Python style guide. <br>
 -Test code and produce an error-free program.
